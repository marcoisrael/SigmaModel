	abstract = {The individual spins of the Ising model are assumed to interact with an external agency (e.g., a heat reservoir) which causes them to change their states randomly with time. Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time-varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak-field limit. Some fluctuation-dissipation theorems are derived which relate the susceptibility to the Fourier transform of the time-dependent correlation function of the magnetization at equilibrium.},

On noiseless maps, we can measure string tensions down to order 10−9, however when noise is included we are unable to measure string tensions below 10−7. Motivated by this impasse, we derive an information theoretic bound on the detection of the cosmic string tension Gμ from {CMB} maps. In particular, we bound the information entropy of the posterior distribution of Gμ in terms of the resolution, noise level and total survey area of the {CMB} map. We evaluate these bounds for the {ACT}, {SPT}-3G, Simons Observatory, Cosmic Origins Explorer, and {CMB}-S4 experiments. These bounds cannot be saturated by any method.},

	abstract = {Experimental results reveal that the asymmetric flow of shear-thinning fluid through a cylindrical pipe, which was previously associated with the laminar-turbulent transition process, appears to have the characteristics of a nonhysteretic, supercritical instability of the laminar base state. Contrary to what was previously believed, classical transition is found to be responsible for returning symmetry to the flow. An absence of evidence of the instability in simulations (either linear or nonlinear) suggests that an element of physics is lacking in the commonly used rheological model for inelastic shear-thinning fluids. These unexpected discoveries raise new questions regarding the stability of these practically important fluids and how they can be successfully modeled.},
